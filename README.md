-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Canarymod plugin implementing a subset and superset of the Minecraft Pi Socket API.

Migrated from the RaspberryJuice bukkit plugin. Original work by zhuowei

https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice

http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice/

Features currently supported:
 - world.get/setBlock
 - world.getBlockWithData
 - world.setBlocks
 - world.getPlayerIds
 - world.getBlocks
 - chat.post
 - events.clear
 - events.block.hits
 - player.getTile
 - player.setTile
 - player.getPos
 - player.setPos
 - world.getHeight

Features that can't be supported:
 - Camera angles

Extra features(**):
 - getBlocks(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2) has been implemented
 - multiplayer support
   - name added as an option parameter to player.
   - modded minecraft.py in python api library so player "name" can be passed on Minecraft.create(ip, port, name)
   - this change does not stop standard python api library being used
   - the default tcp port can be changed in config/CanaryRaspberryJuicePlugin/CanaryRaspberryJuicePlugin.cfg

** to use the extra features an modded version of the java and python libraries that were originally supplied by Mojang with the Pi is required, https://github.com/martinohanlon/CanaryRaspberryJuice/tree/master/resources/mcpi.  You only need the modded libraries to use the extra features, the original libraries still work, you just wont be able to use the extra features
